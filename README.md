# Stock-Analysis-using-RNN-LSTM

## Overview 

The project outlined focuses on predicting the performance of the Nifty 50 index for the fiscal year 2022/23 using various statistical approaches, deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, and additional methodologies to enhance predictive accuracy. The process involves several steps, including data collection, pre-processing, model building, feature engineering, training, testing, and evaluation of the predictive models. The overall framework includes:

## Data Collection and Pre-processing:
Collecting stock market information for Nifty 50 companies, including prices, trading volumes, and relevant metrics.

Data cleaning to rectify errors and handle missing values.

Scaling and normalization of data for uniformity and easier model training.

## Feature Engineering and Selection:
Deriving additional indicators (e.g., returns, log returns, percentage changes) to capture price swings and trends.

Incorporating technical indicators and other external data sources to enhance model predictive ability.

## Model Development using RNN and LSTM:
Utilizing TensorFlow in Python to construct RNN and LSTM models.

Designing multi-layered LSTM cells to capture temporal relationships in sequence data.

Implementing components like dropout layers and batch normalization to prevent overfitting.

## Model Training and Testing:
Splitting the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for model evaluation.

Adjusting hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs) for optimal model performance.

Assessing model accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for evaluation.

## Enhancement Techniques:
Employing indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Exponential Moving Average Forecast (EMAF), and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to validate predictions.

Conducting secondary data analysis for informed insights into Nifty 50 index performance.

## Limitations and Ethical Considerations:
Acknowledging limitations such as index composition and its correlation with the broader economy.

Addressing ethical considerations like data privacy, bias reduction, market manipulation prevention, and aiming for the study's positive impact on economic growth and financial ecosystem health.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic approach to forecasting the Nifty 50 index's performance for the fiscal year, integrating various data sources, advanced modeling techniques, and ethical considerations to ensure responsible research practices.
